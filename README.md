# Innovation-Portal-Indian-Railways
I interned at IndTel Solutions, where I collaborated with The Indian Railways on the 'Innovation Portal' Website. I developed and enhanced web applications using frontend technologies, gaining hands-on experience in the software development life cycle (SDLC) process, including design, coding, and debugging.
